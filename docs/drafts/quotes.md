"Measurement is the first step that leads to control and eventually to improvement.

If you can’t measure something, you can’t understand it.

If you can’t understand it, you can’t control it.

If you can’t control it, you can’t improve it."

said American businessman, author, and improvement guru, Dr. H. James Harrington.
